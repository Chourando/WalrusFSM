# WalrusFSM v1.0.1

**WalrusFSM** is an easy to use **Finite State Machine** library for **GameMaker Studio 2.3**.

[Download from itch.io!](https://mors-games.itch.io/WalrusFSM)

For those who don't know, finite state machines are structures that can exist in a set amount of predefined states. Each one of these states can be given unique behaviors, abd you can easily switch between them just by using a single method.

Finite state machines used very commonly in game development, but GameMaker does not have a built in way of setting them up. This library allows you to set up your own state machines very easily with minimal effort.

---

This library comes with 8 public methods, all of them being static methods within the Finite State Machine struct.
- add(index, state)
- remove(index)
- update()
- change(index)
- next()
- count()
- clear()
- destroy()

This library is only tested on Windows, and it currently does NOT work on HTML5. If you have any idea what could be the cause of this please let me know. It also comes with an example project that will teach you the basics.

The entirety of this project is licensed under **MPL 2.0**. Please give me credit if you end up using this library, otherwise I will be very sad.
