# WalrusFSM

**WalrusFSM** is an easy to use **Finite State Machine** script for **Game Maker Studio 2.3**.
It comes with 8 public methods, all of them being static methods within the Finite State Machine struct.
- add
- remove
- update
- change
- next
- count
- clear
- destroy

It's only tested on Windows, and it currently does NOT work on HTML5. I wish I knew why. It also comes with an example project that will teach you the basics.
